# 📊 Algorithm Visualization Project
# Project Description

This project is an Algorithm Visualization System designed to help users understand how algorithms work internally through step-by-step visual representation. Instead of treating algorithms as black boxes, the system visually demonstrates how data changes at each stage of execution, making complex logic easier to grasp.

The project focuses on bridging the gap between theory and practice by transforming abstract algorithmic steps into interactive and intuitive visuals. It is especially useful for students, educators, and beginners who want to build a strong conceptual foundation in data structures and algorithms.
